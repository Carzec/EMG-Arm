# EMG-Arm
Video of an EMG arm I build Fall semester of Sophomore Year

This build was for a school project! 
I was in a group with two other students. We build a circuit to amplify the electrical signals from our forearm muscles using resistors, capacitors, and
op amps. From there, I wrote code for an Arduino Uno to display the amplified voltage. From there, I worked on more Arduino code to use the signal to 
operate servo motors. We configured the servos using 3D printed parts to simulate an arm gripping a ball and dropping it to another position.
